# Discord.js

Discord.js is a JavaScript library that allows developers to interact with the Discord API. It allows developers to create bots and automate tasks on a Discord server. The library provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the Discord API, including functionality for sending and receiving messages, managing server members, and more. It uses an event-based system, which means that bots can respond to events such as message or voice state updates, and take actions based on those events.
